<br /><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you bought a Kindle Fire and want to use it only for reading, don’t worry you will be fine, but if you want to use it as a tablet, as soon as you try to write something in a language other than English, you will realize that you gave to yourself a pretty expensive brick ;).&nbsp; The Kindle Fire comes with an autocomplete feature (that cannot be disabled) that inserts matching words when you press the space bar, while this is arguable a nice thing, if you are writing in a language such as Spanish it’s a bit of a pain in the ass. You have to erase and retype all of the words inserted by this feature.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Surfing the web you will find a lots of comments saying that is not possible to change the Kindle Fire's keyboard layout, while this is true based upon the Fire’s defaults options, there is a guy who hacked the system and give us a neat way to change it. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This guy is Gero Zahn and this is how he did it <span lang="ES"><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://blog.gerozahn.de/2011/11/kindle-fire-keyboard-layouts-solved/">http://blog.gerozahn.de/2011/11/kindle-fire-keyboard-layouts-solved/</a></span></span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span lang="ES"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span lang="ES"></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>There is another way to do it, also based on the solution discovered by Gero, but those guys found a way to do the same trick in only one step!</b><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can grab it from github at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/shaftekbiz/android-language-settings-app">https://github.com/shaftekbiz/android-language-settings-app</a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">I 've tried the last one and worked like a charm.
