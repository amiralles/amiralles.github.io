I've been long time user of the NUnit framework (I mean for ages) and I was quite happy with the overall experience. Good performance, lots of tests runners, great integration with Visual Studio, reasonable documentation, the list goes on and on... But lately I've been working mostly on mac and/or linux, and on that space, the experience wasn't that great.<br /><br />I still advocate for TDD (and any kind of automated tests for that matter) but I have to admit that doing TDD with NUnit outside Visual Studio (and without ReSharper support) was quite tedious. While NUnit comes with a console runner, I guess it's there just for CI Servers and not for developers to use. I mean you can use it, but the output is xml... and ... should I say more? ;)<br /><br />So with that problem at hand, I decided to write <b>Contest</b>, a small library that allows me to do <b>TDD on .NET with just an editor and a console</b>. Basic feature set but capable enough to get stuff done. And of course, easy to use from de console.<br /><br />Sounds interesting? Then take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/amiralles/contest" target="_blank">Contest Github page</a><br /><br />As usual, feedback is welcomed and thanks for reading!<br /><div><br /></div>
